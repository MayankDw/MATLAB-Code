Functions

To create a function, type the function code in a text editor (e.g. gedit or notepad), and save the file as "functionName.m"

Example function:



        function y = squareThisNumber(x)
        y = x^2;


To call the function in Octave, do either:

1) Navigate to the directory of the functionName.m file and call the function:



    % Navigate to directory:
    cd /path/to/function
    % Call the function:
    functionName(args)


2) Add the directory of the function to the load path and save it:You should not use addpath/savepath for any of the assignments in this course. Instead use 'cd' to change the current working directory. Watch the video on submitting assignments in week 2 for instructions.



    % To add the path for the current session of Octave:
    addpath('/path/to/function/')
    % To remember the path for future sessions of Octave, after executing 
      addpath above, also do:
    savepath


Octave's functions can return more than one value:

    function [y1, y2] = squareandCubeThisNo(x)
    y1 = x^2
    y2 = x^3


Call the above function this way:

    [a,b] = squareandCubeThisNo(x)
