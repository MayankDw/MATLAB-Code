Vectorization

Vectorization is the process of taking code that relies on loops and converting it into matrix operations. It is more efficient, more elegant, and more concise.
As an example, let's compute our prediction from a hypothesis. Theta is the vector of fields for the hypothesis and x is a vector of variables.

With loops:


		prediction = 0.0;
		for j = 1:n+1,
		  prediction += theta(j) * x(j);
		end;


With vectorization:

prediction = theta' * x;


If you recall the definition multiplying vectors, you'll see that this one operation does the element-wise multiplication and overall sum in a very concise notation.
